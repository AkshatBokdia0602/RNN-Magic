# RNN-Magic 🪄

Welcome to **RNN Magic**! This project utilizes Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to generate new spell names inspired by the Harry Potter universe. By training on existing spells, the model learns patterns and structures that it then uses to create unique and creative spell names.

## Prerequisites 🛠️

Before running the code in this project, make sure you have the following libraries and tools installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (optional)
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, TensorFlow.
  
You can install the required packages using the following command:
```bash
   pip install tensorflow numpy pandas jupyter
   ```

## Data 💾

The project includes a CSV file (Harry_Potter_Spells.csv) containing existing Harry Potter spell names used to train the RNN model. Ensure this file is in the same directory as the Jupyter notebook.

## Project Overview 🎯

The project can be summarized in the following steps:
1. Importing necessary libraries.
2. Importing the dataset.
3. Summarizing the dataset, including its shape and a preview of the data.
4. Data visualization to gain insights into the dataset.
5. Processing the text in order to prepare the text data for training.
6. Building and training an RNN model and evaluating its performance.
7. Generating new spell names using the trained model.
